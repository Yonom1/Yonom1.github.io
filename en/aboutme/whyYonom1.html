    <p>The first meaningful gift my girlfriend gave me was a teacup. It's entirely black with a delicate matte texture and a warm wooden handle. The body is printed with a "Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains" painting, and it thoughtfully came with a lid and a tea strainer.</p>
    <p>Since then, "teacup" became my online name. In English, of course, it's "teacup" — both meaningful and fitting.</p>
    <p>However, as I used it, I started to feel that the pronunciation of "teacup" wasn't quite smooth — the first syllable was too long, and the ending too short. Reading it always felt a bit uncomfortable, and it was a bit too ordinary. So I began to wonder, could I say "teacup" in another language?</p>
    <p>I thought of Japanese, which shares roots with Chinese and carries a certain charm. In Japanese, "teacup" is written as "湯飲み" and pronounced <strong>Yonomi</strong>. I liked the pronunciation, but I felt the letters were a bit too "conventional." So, referencing the naming habits of the Valorant professional scene, I replaced the final "i" with a "1" — which is both a bit trendy and adds some personal flair.</p>
    <p>And that's how <strong>Yonom1</strong> was born. This name holds a memory and carries my style and preferences.</p>
